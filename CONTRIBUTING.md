### Setting up local environment

A quick guide on how to setup your ZITADEL app locally to work on it and test out any changes:

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-angular.git
cd zitadel-angular
```

3. Install packages. Developing requires Node.js v16:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Set up `environment`:

Go to `src/app/app.modules.ts`

Replace <YOUR DOMAIN> (4 times) with the domain of your own ZITADEL instance
Replace <YOUR APPS CLIENT ID HERE> (once) with your application clientId

5. Start the developer application/server:

```sh
npm start
```

Your developer application will be available on `http://localhost:4200`

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
